# Assignment 2 - Temperature Converter

## Author

Brandon Rodriguez

## Description

A simple temperature conversion phone app.

User can input a temperature, including decimals and negatives. This input is then converted to/from any of the following: Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, or Rankine.

For each conversion, the user will see both the input temperature and the converted temperature, as well as the standard equation generally used for such a conversion.

Data is saved on screen rotate and persistant until end of application.

## Project Requirements

Create a temperature converter application.
The application should look like the screen shots I have provided.
The application should do the calculation and display the formula that was used to do the calculation.
The calculation of the conversion should take place in a seperate class
The application should handle errors gracefully.
The application should have a different layout for landscape form that looks like the one pictured here.
The application must retain it's information on the screen when rotated to lanscape.

Solution Requirements:

* Seperate class for calculation
* Handle errors gracefully
* Seperate Layout for landscape
* Retain information across rotation
